# shared terraform action templates

## Set up:

Before committing, please set your git username like this:

```
git config user.name 'tasty sandstone'
git config user.email '110632668+tastysandstone@users.noreply.github.com'
```

_this address found [here in github email settings](https://github.com/settings/emails)_

This way your true identity remains anonymous.

## Why?

The point of this project is to allow for micro-repos containing terraform to use these workflows in their github actions.

This is anonymous so that nobody can see which org you're using it for.

There's a limitation in github where a shared workflow can only be in a public repo.

So, if you use this, and commit to it, do it with a private email such as what's shown above so nobody can glean info on your true Organization or repo.
